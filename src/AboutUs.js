            <p>Dummy data isn’t exactly dumb — on the contrary. Analysts that use dummy data are often 
                the smart ones in the room, since dummy data is kind a safety mechanism for data integrity.
                It’s a trial subject of sorts, applied to unknown programs, or program modifications, before 
                valuable data is used.
